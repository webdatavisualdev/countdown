# Countdown

## Improved countdown
The below component was designed to count down the days until our CTO's birthday, but it still needs some work. How can you make the implementation better?

**Do a critique:** The current implementation isn't perfect. How could it be improved?

* Pick an area of improvement to implement.
  - Change folder structure
  - Validate date for Countdown props
  - Update styling
* What would happen to the current code if the date were changed, the page layout was changed or the format was changed?
  - If the date was changed, Countdown would count for both past and future date
  - If the page layout was changed, Countdown wouldn't change it's layout.
  - If the format was changed, Countdown wouldn't change it's format.
* Does the current implementation follow best practices for HTML, CSS, JS and React?
  - No, it doesn't. I changed the folder structure to follow best practice.

**Spice it up:** Let's be honest, this countdown could be a whole lot more exciting.

* What could you do to create a greater sense of urgency?
  - I could update the design.
* How would you make this countdown more aesthetically pleasing?
  - I think introducing some animations will make more pleasing.
* Trust your design instincts, and explain how your design choices impact the user experience
  - My design choice is to emphasize the count values so users will notice easily how much time is left until the birthday.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
